                <p>In the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC in Boeotia, Alexander at the young age of 18 lead the cavalry wing and annihilated the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite corps previously regarded as invincible.</p>
                <li><b>Alexander became King of Macedonia at the age of 20.</b></li>
                <p>Alexander was proclaimed King of Macedonia at the age of 20. The death of his father caused revolts across greece states. He was quick to respond riding with 3000 cavalry south to Thessaly forcing them into submission.</p>
                <li><b>In Just 2 Yeasrs Alexander Ensured complete control over greece</b></li>
                <p>Before his Asian campaign Alexander wanted to secure his northern frontiers. He marched north and crushed the all revolting states. These victories finally brought the whole of Greece to accept the rule and ensured complete control over Greece to concentrate on Asia.</p>
                <li><b>334 BC Conquest of the Achaemenid Empire</b></li>
                <p>The Achaemenid Empire (The First Persian Empire) one of the largest empires in history. Alexander was ambushed at a the Persian Gate while on his way to Persepolis; the ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire. Heavy losses were inflicted on the Greek army but after holding the gate for a month, the Persians were finally encircled and defeated.</p>
                <li><b>Alexander Demeanor</b></li>
                <p>Alexander was known for being ruthless, persevering, diplomatic and even kind at some junctures. It was perhaps these qualities that sustained his long and treacherous campaign where he was undefeated in battle.</p>
